Ingredients:
- 2 cups flour
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 1 stick butter, chilled
- 1 teaspoon vanilla
- 1 egg
- 1 egg yolk
- 2 tablespoons milk
- 1 cup dulce de membrillo (quince paste), homemade or store-bought
- 1/4 cup pineapple preserves (optional)
- 1/4 cup seedless raspberry jam (optional)

Directions:
1. Mix the dry ingredients (flour, salt, baking powder, and sugar) together in a medium bowl.
2. Cut the butter into pieces, and mix butter into dry ingredients using a pastry cutter or 2 knives, until well blended.
3. Stir egg, egg yolk and milk together and add to flour mixture, blending gently with a fork until dough comes together. Knead a couple of times to just barely mix the dough, which should not be too crumbly nor too wet. If needed, add an extra tablespoon or so of flour or milk.
4. Wrap dough in plastic wrap and chill for at least 30 minutes.
5. Add dulce de membrillo (and pineapple preserves and raspberry jam, if using) to a small pot, with 1-2 tablespoons of water.
6. Heat over low heat, stirring frequently until mixture has melted enough to be smooth and have a spreadable consistency. (add a little more water if necessary). Remove from heat and let cool slightly.
7. Preheat oven to 350 F. Butter a 9=unch tart pan with a removable bottom.
8. Roll out about 3/4 of the dough on a floured surface into a circle large enough to line the bottom and sides of the tart pan. Place the dough in the pan. Spread the filling evenly over the dough.
9. Roll the remaining dough into a circle, and cut thin strips of dough, using them to make a lattice pattern over the top of the tart.
10. Brush the tart lightly with an egg wash (1 egg thinned with 1 tablespoon water), and bake until golden brown (about 30 minutes).
11. Sprinkle with powdered sugar if desired, or brush with an apricot glaze. Serve warm or at room temperature.
